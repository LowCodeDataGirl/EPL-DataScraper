# English Premier League Data Scraper

This repository contains two Python scripts, `scraper(ref).py` and `scraper.py`, that scrape Premier League data from the fbref.com website.  

## Files

1. `scraper(ref).py`: This script fetches Premier League data from the fbref.com website for multiple seasons and saves the extracted data to a CSV file (`matches.csv`).

2. `scraper.py`: This script fetches Premier League data from the fbref.com website for a single season and saves the extracted data to a CSV file (`output/matches.csv`).

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library
- `datetime` library
- `pandas` library
- `time` library
- `os` library
- `BeautifulSoup` library


## Output

- After running `scraper(ref).py`, the scraped data from multiple seasons will be saved as `matches.csv`.

- After running `scraper.py`, the scraped data from a single season will be saved as `output/matches.csv`.

- The generated CSV files can be further processed or used as desired.

## Directory Structure

If running `scraper.py`, the script will create an `output` directory if it doesn't already exist. The output CSV file will be saved inside this directory.
